#Proyect 2ºBIE the laboratory at home
This project is conformed at the software level, one in charge of obtaining and packaging the data; and another that deals with displaying the data graphically and organizing, allowing if desired to save the data obtained during the measurement for possible later use.
It is composed in itself of two parts, the Arduino language code used for the programming of the microcontroller and the code for the computer, in charge of processing the data, being this written in Processing.
It is also important to note that the microcontroller used is a STM32103c8t6, ​​so it will be necessary to add the proper libraries for its use.
